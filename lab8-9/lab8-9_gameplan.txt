## Understanding the data ##
input shape: [1, 2, 4096]
structure: each of the 2048 entries has 2 sensors at a sampling rate of 4096 for 1 sec
obvious patterns: no EM waves following BBH, some EM waves following CCSN, glitch has relatively large disparity between L1 and H1
dataset is very symmetrical, no apparent corruption or size mismatch

## Understanding the task ##
goal: classification
signficance: identifying origin of gravitational wave helps us to evaluate astrophysical models, improve rare event detection
evaluation metric: 
good performance threshold: > 90% test accuracy
baseline to compare after meeting performance: 

## Developing an initial plan ##
input shape: [1, 2, 4096]
output shape: 4 (classification of BBH, CCSN, glitch, background)
preprocessing steps: bandpass filter, whitening, spectrogram? see lecture 6 slides
Model type: RNN, 1D CNN
Loss function: CEL
