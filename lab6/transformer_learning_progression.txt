TA (Darin) recommended the following order to learn Transformers well

RNN -> LSTM -> Seq2Seq -> Attention -> Transformer

Understand each topic well before really diving into the next, and spend extra time on Transformer once there
Very much 'black box' nature to it, especially surrounding KVQ and other components

"Also very unlikely to use agentic AI in the real world, the kind of thing that gets finance bros and AI hype bros excited"
